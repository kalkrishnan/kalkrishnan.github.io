Hi There, my name is Kalyana Krishnan. This blog is a collection of random discoveries I make everyday as I continue to explore the ever changing world of Software development. Needed a place to use as a mind dump which I could reference later and Github's integration with Jekyll served perfectly for this.

Below are the technologies this blog is built upon:

* [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com)
* [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com)

Learn more and contribute on [GitHub](https://github.com/poole).

## Setup

Some fun facts about the setup of this project include:

* Built for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)
* Developed on GitHub and hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)
* Coded with [Sublime Text 2](http://sublimetext.com), an amazing code editor

Thanks for reading!
