After having dealt with enough Production deployment issues, I started looking at docker which is a lightweight container to run applications in. 
Being familiar with Vagrant, I decided to see how the two tie in together.
For the unfamiliar:

Vagrant is an automation tool with a domain-specific language (DSL) that is used 
to automate the creation of VMs and VM environments.
