Finally got bored of seeing my money sit in a savings account and not do much so decided to educate myself on the finer points of investing. 401k's through work are nice, but I wanted to have more control over what I was investing in and actually try to understand the complex and often misleading(see Wolf of Wall Street) world of stocks and bonds.


    Diversify
    ------------------

    Diversification is one of the cliches you hear about investing that people don't really understand. What it means is having an investment portfolio that protects you under various economic fluctuations and minimizes losses while emphasizing gains during these conditions. Various such fluctuations might include:

        * Inflation
        * Deflation
        * Government instability


There are certain decisions that need to be made to allocate assets across a diversified portfolio:

>
* Percentage of portfolio to invest in stocks which generally contain more risk.
* Percentage of allocation to international vs domestic(U.S) stocks. This is not as critical as the first one since both US and international stocks have similar risk profiles and similar long term returns.
* Tax-efficient fund placement. In general, the international fund should go into a taxable account, the bond fund should go into a tax-advantaged account, and the domestic equity fund should fill in the remaining space.


    ETF

    An Exchange Traded fund is a low-expense-ratio index mutual fund. It is a form of an index fund which has consistent benchmarks but the important difference being that it can be traded commission-free where as index funds often have costly commission fees.
