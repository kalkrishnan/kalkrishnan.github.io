Finally got bored of seeing my money sit in a savings account and not do much so decided to educate myself on the finer points of investing. 401k's through work are nice, but I wanted to have more control over what I was investing in and actually try to understand the complex and often misleading(see Wolf of Wall Street) world of stocks and bonds.

Diversify
------------------

Diversification is one of the cliches you hear about investing that people don't really understand. What it means is having an investment portfolio that protects you under various economic fluctuations and minimizes losses while emphasizing gains during these conditions. Various such fluctuations might include:

    * Inflation
    * Deflation
    * Government instability
