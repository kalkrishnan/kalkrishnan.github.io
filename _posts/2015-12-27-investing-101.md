Finally got bored of seeing my money sit in a savings account and not do much so decided to educate myself on the finer points of investing. 401k's through work are nice, but I wanted to have more control over what I was investing in and actually try to understand the complex and often misleading(see Wolf of Wall Street) world of stocks and bonds.
